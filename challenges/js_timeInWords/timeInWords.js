/*
The Time in Words

Given the time in numerals we may convert it into words, as shown below:

5:00 -> five o' clock
5:01 -> one minute past five
5:10 -> ten minutes past five
5:15 -> quarter past five
5:30 -> half past five
5:40 -> twenty minutes to six
5:45 -> quarter to six
5:47 -> thirteen minutes to six
5:28 -> twenty eight minutes past five

At minutes = 0, use o' clock. For 1 <= minutes <= 30 , use past, and for 30 > minutes use to. Note the space between the apostrophe and clock in o' clock. Write a program which prints the time in words for the input given in the format described.
